/*
 * ChargingNotify — the CHF reaching a live session (TS 32.291 §6.3.4).
 *
 * The CHF only ever answers the SMF, so anything that changes a
 * subscriber's quota from the side - a top-up through the TMF API, a bar,
 * an edited plan - waits for that session's next report.  With grants
 * capped at 50 MiB and five minutes that is up to five minutes, and for an
 * idle session it is the full five.
 *
 * ChargingNotify closes that gap.  The SMF hands the CHF a notifyUri in
 * every ChargingDataRequest; the CHF POSTs a ChargingNotifyRequest there
 * and the SMF answers by reporting at once, which is what fetches the new
 * grant.  Two kinds, per TS 32.291:
 *
 *   REAUTHORIZATION — the quota changed; report and take a fresh grant.
 *   ABORT_CHARGING  — this session may not continue; release it.
 *
 * What starts it is a row in chf.notifications, written by the billing
 * side and polled here.  See db-handler.h for why a queue.
