/*
 * The TS 32.298 CHF CDR, as a record.
 *
 * One closing session becomes one CHFRecord, and that record is the only
 * CDR model the CHF has.  Both encodings serialise it: BER through asn1c
 * (chf_cdr_record_encode_ber) and JSON through cdr-json.c.  Writing the
 * two from one structure is what keeps them mirror images - a field added
 * here appears in both files, with the same name, or in neither.
 *
 * The record is the 5G SA subset of TS 32.298 clause 5.2.5: a
 * ChargingRecord carrying pDUSessionChargingInformation, with the
 * uplink/downlink volumes in listOfMultipleUnitUsage.  Which fields are
 * present and why is documented field by field in cdr-record.c.
 *
 * The types come from lib/asn1c/cdr, generated from the published 3GPP
 * module; see lib/asn1c/support/cdr-r19.6.0/.
