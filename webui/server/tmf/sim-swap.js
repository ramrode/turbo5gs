/*
 * SIM swap — move a subscriber's data balances to a new SIM.

 *   POST /prepayBalanceManagement/v4/simSwap          swap
 *   GET  /prepayBalanceManagement/v4/simSwap[?logicalResource.id=&status=]
 *   GET  /prepayBalanceManagement/v4/simSwap/{id}
 *
 * TMF654 has no SIM swap.  This is an extension in its namespace, shaped as
 * a TMF630 task resource like topupBalance, and it borrows the names TMF654
 * TransferBalance uses for the two ends: `logicalResource` is the SIM being
 * replaced and `receiverLogicalResource` the one replacing it.
 *
 * What it does: every bucket of the old SUPI becomes a bucket of the new
 * one.  The document is moved, not copied, so the plan, the scope, the
 * priority, the billing account and this cycle's counter - what was used and
 * what was topped up - all arrive unchanged, and the CHF charges the new SIM
 * from its first session.  Nothing is left with the old SUPI.
