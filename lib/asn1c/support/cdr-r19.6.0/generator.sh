# Regenerate the TS 32.298 CHF CDR ASN.1 encoder/decoder.
#
#   standard/  pristine 3GPP modules, exactly as published on 3GPP Forge
#   patched/   the only hand-written ASN.1: the records trimmed to 5G SA,
#              plus corrections for defects in the published module
#   closure.py standard + patched -> modified/  (a self-contained module)
#   modified/  the asn1c input, committed so review can read it
#   asn1c      modified/ -> lib/asn1c/cdr/
#
# Usage:
#   ASN1C=/path/to/asn1c/asn1c/asn1c ./generator.sh
#
# See ../README.md ("Regenerate the CHF CDR ASN.1 files") for how to build
# asn1c and which commit to use.

# TS 29.002 MAP, CAMEL CAP and ITU-T CMIP/ACSE/X.721.  Nothing on the 5G SA
# PDU-session path needs any of it, so closure.py keeps only what the
# trimmed records actually reach - 26 types, of which 21 are copied
# verbatim from standard/.

# BER is the one encoding kept: TS 32.298 clause 6.1 requires it on Bx
# ("Data Record Format" 1).  asn1c's encoder emits DER, which is a
# canonical subset of BER, so any BER decoder reads what we write.
#
# NGAP and S1AP are generated with -no-gen-BER and keep APER instead; the
# CDR codec is the mirror image, so it cannot share their runtime.  See
# ../../cdr/meson.build.

#
# asn_internal.h is the one skeleton open5gs modifies (see ../README.md).
# lib/asn1c/common already carries the patched form of the same file, so
# we copy it rather than re-deriving the patch here, and keep the patch
# itself in one place.
#
# This directory deliberately keeps its own full copy of the asn1c
# runtime instead of sharing lib/asn1c/common.  asn_config.h is written
# by asn1c from the -no-gen-* flags above, so common's copy has BER off
# and this one has it on - and a C quote-include resolves against the
# including file's own directory first.  Sharing common's sources would
# therefore compile them against common's asn_config.h, giving the shared
# runtime and the generated code two different layouts for
# asn_TYPE_operation_s.  That mismatch links cleanly and crashes later,
# so the duplication buys a real guarantee.
